A serverless, event-driven order processing workflow built on **AWS Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, **SQS**, and **SNS** â€” designed for scalability, fault tolerance, and automated notifications.

 Overview

This project demonstrates a **cloud-native order pipeline** where orders flow through DynamoDB, get processed asynchronously via SQS and Lambda, and trigger SNS notifications upon updates or failures.

Tech Stack

* **AWS Lambda** â€“ Core compute for order processing & notification
* **Amazon DynamoDB** â€“ NoSQL order storage
* **Amazon SQS (DLQ)** â€“ Reliable, decoupled message queue
* **Amazon SNS** â€“ Real-time alerts & notifications
* **Serverless Framework** â€“ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* **GitHub Actions** â€“ CI/CD for automated deployments
